<p>Alright alright, the April edition of Messy Mixes with the best music I listened to in the last month, as always. I also know some of the transitions are kinda sloppy, but it's currently my birthday and I've been celebrating. I have a bunch of dark techno/electrohouse tracks in the middle (around 18 mins in to around 30 minutes) and I wanted to start with that segment, but it's not very radio friendly. I've been listening to a lot of dark music lately because I'm still trying to find enough for a good Halloween mix, but here's a little taste of what hopefully it'll be like once October rolls around.</p>

<p>I've also been trying to recreate some transitions/mixes from various live sets, starting with Gesaffelstein's AMAZING transition from Send It Up to Hellifornia. I also recreated Deadmau5's mix of Stephan Bodzin's remix of Sleepless and the vocals of I Remember. That was a fun one. Last is ATTLAS's mashup of So Long by Joris Voorn with Teenage Crime (jeez, remember that song?). </p>
