<p>Sorry all! I graduated in 2018 and just moved, so the WXTJ shows aren't being recorded anymore (at least for the time being until I figure out the future of it). BUT! I still have all the prior recordings from 2016-2018, so shoot me a message at jys3ed if you want specific ones sent to you!</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, use the archive page in the staff tools! Apparently it goes back 1 week, so be sure to download your shows while you can!</p>

<p>Thanks for being awesome, WXTJ.</p>
