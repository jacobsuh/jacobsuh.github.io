Sorry all! I graduated this year and just moved, so the WXTJ shows aren't being recorded anymore (at least for the time being until I figure it all out). BUT! I still have all the prior recordings and I'll get them back up here as soon as I can!

In the meanwhile, use the archive in the staff tools! Apparently t goes back 1 week, so be sure to download your shows while you can!

Thanks for being awesome, WXTJ.
